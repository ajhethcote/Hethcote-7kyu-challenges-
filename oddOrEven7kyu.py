#Your solution code:
    #As seen below.

#A short explanation (3â€“4 sentences) of how your solution works.
    # It loops through the array, checking each number using the modulo operator and dividing by two to see if there is a remainder. 
    # If there is no remainder, it returns "even", else it returns "odd".
    #This one also doesn't pass the codewars tests, but works with what I throw at it in VS code, and I can't figure out why. :/
